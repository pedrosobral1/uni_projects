Implementation for the ID3 algorithm that creates a decision tree and all the data
structures needed to generate an efficient tree. The algorithm is arranged to
receive a set of sample data through a .csv. We've implemented the algorithm in Java.

//=================================================================//

Execute: -Open the terminal
         -Go to the work folder and compile with the following: $javac DecisionTree.java
         -To execute it just write to the command line: $java DecisionTree3
	 -Then you may choose with what file you want to creat a decision tree(that file need to be in the same work folder as the program):

//=================================================================//

NOTE: This program will only work correctly if the column class (last column) is "Yes" (or "yes") or "No" (or "no")

//=================================================================//

The program was compiled and run in Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS with openjdk 1.8.0_191.
